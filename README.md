## Project 1: [Dataset based on Medical Insurance](https://github.com/AimanAzmanCoding/Portfolio-Project/tree/main/Project%201%20(Medical%20Insurance))
This is a group project I did for my short course program, where we need to find a dataset and utilized Python for data collection, data wrangling, data exploration and modeling, and result interpretation.
Then, PowerBi used for data visualization.

* Data was taken from kaggle [Medical Insurance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajgupta2019/medical-insurance-dataset?select=Train_Data.csv)
* Data wrangling using Python [[Coding Works]](https://github.com/AimanAzmanCoding/Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Project%201%20(Medical%20Insurance)/Mini%20Project%20(Medical_Insurance).ipynb)
* Data modelling by using LinearRegression to produce a final model with an accuracy of 74%
* Data cleanup was used to create Dashboard using PowerBi
